  Supplier - Our Business - Customer workflow
</Image>

A customer is an individual or business that purchase the goods or services produced by a business. Attracting customers is the primary goal of most businesses because it is the customer who creates the demand for products and services. Customers can come in the form of an organization (a company) or a person (a contact). The behavior of these groups is so different that we separate them instead of making them under a single Customer category. For Marketing and Sales departments, we need to keep track of every single interaction with the customers to sell or promote the products. There is a timeline to understand what we (as a business) say to them (as a business partner or a contact).
