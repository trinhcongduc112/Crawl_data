## STEP 1: Create an organization

If you don't have an Abivin vRoute account, [sign up here](https://docs.abivin.com/v3.0/docs/how-to-sign-up-an-owner-account). Then, [sign in here](doc:how-to-sign-in).

After the first successful sign in, there is a pop-up window asking you to choose the model that fits your business.

You can create the first organization by following [How to create an Organization](doc:how-to-create-an-organization).

## STEP 2: Create organizational resources

Each [Organization](doc:organizations) manages various type of resources. The resources includes: Role Groups, Users, [Products](doc:products), [Orders](doc:orders), [Partners](doc:partners) and [Tasks](doc:tasks-actions-forms). In order to import all of the resource data using Excel files, follow [Import Data](doc:import-data) guide.

If you want to specifically create a certain type of resources, please follow the below tutorials: 

* [How to create a User](doc:how-to-create-a-user) 
* [How to create a Customer](doc:how-to-create-a-customer-information) 
* [How to create an Order](doc:how-to-create-an-order)
* [How to create a Product](doc:how-to-create-a-product) 

<Image title="vApp DB Diagram - Structure.png" alt={1216} src="https://files.readme.io/d179609-vApp_DB_Diagram_-_Structure.png">
  The diagram explains the order for resource creation, starting with the owner, then organizations.\
  Inside each organization, we can have three options:\
  (1) create user groups and users\
  (2) create customers, suppliers and their groups\
  (3) create product categories, product and inventory quantities\
  After all of these resources are created, an action form can be designed and users are ready to complete their SMART-goal tasks. Once the tasks are completed, operational reports and analytical reports can be generated automatically.

## STEP 3: Operate efficiently with Abivin vRoute

The system has been carefully designed with common popular User Experience like [Pagination](doc:paging), [Searching and Filtering](doc:filtering) or [Export Data](doc:export-data).

Once some data is uploaded, you can start getting [Reports](doc:operational-report) and [Dashboards](doc:dashboards).

Enjoy working in your organization with Abivin!
