* Assuming that you have done the following actions for the Depots/xDocs under your Branch management:
* Created orders (Please refer to the [**Manage Orders**](https://docs.abivin.com/docs/manage-distribution-center-order#section-create-orders) article for instruction)
* Configured vehicles and drivers (Please refer to the [**Manage Vehicles**](https://docs.abivin.com/docs/vehicle-management#section-create-vehicles) and [**Manage Drivers (Delivery men)**](https://docs.abivin.com/docs/manage-drivers-delivery-men) articles for instructions)
* You can now perform delivery route optimization for all the orders of your Branch

## Optimize delivery route

* Navigate to **Transportation - Vehicle List** tab
* Click on **View Map** icon
* The **Optimization** screen will display
* Select the *Branch* for which you want to perform route optimization from the **Branch** field

> 📘 In case the network is slow and the **Branch** field doesn't display automatically, you can type the organization code of the branch into the field, then click :fa-times: icon. The system will sort out the branch with that code

* Next, click on **Date** field and select the *Execution Date* (Not the *Creation Date*) of the orders from the drop down calendar. You can also type the date directly into this field in the format mm/dd/yyyy (For example 07/22/2019)
* After configuring the *Branch* and the *Execution Date*, click on **Select**
* The system will pre-generate the orders delivered from the selected Depots/xDocks under the selected Branch's management, that will be executed on the selected date on a panel called **Timeline panel**
* To begin the route optimization process, you need to click on **Optimize** button at the bottom right of the Timeline panel, then click **Optimize** one more time on the pop up **Optimize Route** form
* The optimization process will occur. This process will take in account the input data of various configurations and constraints that the you have set earlier, and generate the most optimized delivery routes for the orders
* After a few moments, the optimized routes for all orders originated from the selected Branch will display on the Timeline panel

## Timeline panel description

* On the Timeline panel, there are many sections. Below is the breakdown of each section:
* **First section**

- There is a button that allows you to switch between the **Plan routes** - Routes that are optimized and generated by Abivin vRoute, and the **Actual routes** - Routes that the drivers actually travel

* You can also change the width of the Timeline panel by clicking on the **Artboard** icons on the right side of the toolbar. The number of rows on each artboard icon corresponds to the number of vehicle rows shown on the Timeline panel

- You can also click on **All** to show the maxium 5 rows, or click on :fa-arrow-down: icon to completely hide the Timeline panel. To show it back, click on ::fa-arrow-up: **Timeline panel** button

* **Second section**
* This section is the timeline bar, showing the optimized timeline for each route. Notice there is a :fa-eye: icon. Click on it will show the optimized routes of all vehicles on the map. To hide all the routes, click on that icon again

- **Third section**
- This section lists the **Missing orders** - Codes of the oders that could not be optimized due to various reasons
- You can click on :fa-caret-left: or :fa-caret-right: button to scroll between this list. 

* You can also click on **Show more** to show the entire list of missing orders

- You can click on the code. Upon clicking, a thumbnail will pop out, showing the information of that order

## Export Packing List and Order List

* On the **Packing List** and **Order List** forms, you can **Export** them to Excel templates to view offline

## Rearrange orders on route

* If the route has not been locked, you can rearrange the orders in a shift by clicking and dragging the representative number of that order on the timeline panel to another position in that shift
* Wait a few moment, the route will automatically regenerate 

## Driver assignment

You can assign a driver to the vehicle by clicking on that icon. The **Assign to Driver** form will appear. Click on the **Driver** field, select a driver from the drop down menu and click **Assign** to confirm the assignment

## Case 1: Vehicle has not been assigned default driver

* If a vehicle has not been assigned default driver, during route optimization, that vehicle will be automatically assigned a driver who drives that vehicle type. For example, if the vehicle type is *truck*, then the assigned driver's vehicle type will be *truck* as well
* After route optimization a, if the dispatcher wants to assign another driver to a specific vehicle that has been automatically assigned, he can do so by:
* Click on **Route Details** icon
* Click on **Driver assign** icon
* Choose a suitable driver on the list that appears

![1361](https://files.readme.io/70f3557-p5.png "p5.png")

 The vehicle's default driver will have been changed successfully

> ❗️ If the vehicle route has been locked, the dispatcher will not be able to assign another driver for that vehicle

##

## Case 2: Vehicle has been assigned default driver

### Case 2.1 One driver is assigned to one vehicle

* The vehicle will be assigned a driver by default, and only that driver will operate that vehicle during route optimization
* To do this, follow the steps below:
* Navigate to **Transportation > Vehicle List** tab
* Click **Edit** :fa-pencil: icon on the row of the vehicle the dispatcher want to assign default driver
* Scroll down the **Update Vehicle** form. Click on the **Default driver** field, choose a driver as the default driver for that vehicle
* Click **Update** to confirm the change

![1361](https://files.readme.io/d4c546b-p6.png "p6.png")

After route optimization, the default driver will show up as the above image

> 📘 In the scenario a vehicle is optimized multiple times simultaneously (Which means that vehicle will have multiple shifts), then all shifts will still be assigned to that default driver configured above

![1918](https://files.readme.io/7ef80d4-p7.png "p7.png")

### Case 2.2: One driver is assigned to multiple vehicles

* In this case, multiple vehicles are configured to have the same default driver (See Case 2.1 for configuration steps)
* During route optimization, that default driver will be assigned to those vehicles 

> ❗️ In both cases, if the vehicle (or vehicles) has been assigned a default driver, the dispatcher will not be able to select another driver during route optimization

**Special case**: Assign consecutive orders to one driver\
If the dispatcher wants to assign one single driver to operate multiple consecutive orders, delivered by multiple different vehicles, he can do so by:

* Create the first order, perform route optimization
* Take note of the complete time and the driver code of the first order
* Go back to the **Transportation > Vehicle List** tab, find the vehicle which operates this order
* Click **Edit** :fa-pencil: for that vehicle
* Change the **Stop time** of that vehicle to a time point shortly after the time point when the first order is completed. For example, if the first order is completed at 11:00, then the **Stop time** of the vehicle can be set to around 11:10
* Click **Update** to confirm the change
* Perform route optimization for the first order again, this time also **Lock route** to send the order tasks to the driver's mobile app

<Image title="Driver.png" alt={1677} className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/838cdfb-Driver.png" />

* Copy the *driver code* of that order
* Create the second order
* Perform route optimization for the second order, choose the *Cut-off time* of the second order at a time point later than the *Complete time* of the first order

<Image title="driver 2.png" alt={1677} className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/27569b8-driver_2.png" />

* Go back to the **Transportation > Vehicle List** tab, find the vehicle which operates the second order
* Click **Edit** :fa-pencil: for that vehicle
* Paste the *driver code* of the first order into the **Default driver** field of that vehicle
* Change the **Start time** of this vehicle to a suitable time point after the complete time of the first order. The **Stop time** of this vehicle can be calculated by the sum of the recently configured **Start time** and the optimized time period to perform the order. For example, if the first order completes at 11:00, the dispatcher can set the **Start time** of the vehicle which will operate the second order to 12:00 (which allows the driver to rest for 1 hour). The second order, from the route optimization result, will take around 05 hours to operate. Therefore, the **Stop time** of the vehicle should be set to 12:00 + 05:00 = 17:00 
* Click **Update** to confirm

<Image title="driver 3.png" alt={1677} className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/936671a-driver_3.png" />

* Go back to the route optimization map screen, perform route optimization again
* Lock route for the second order
* By doing this, the task of these two consecutive orders will be sent to only one driver's mobile app

The dispatcher can continue assigning other consecutive orders to the same driver using this method
