An order is an instruction to engage in a commercial transaction for products or services. When acting as a buyer, vRoute expresses the intention to buy via a purchase order. When acting as a seller, vRoute expresses the intention to sell via a sales order. When the purchase order of the buyer and the sales order of the seller come to an agreement, the orders become a contract between the buyer and seller.

In an order, users specify a list of products defined previously in Products section. Each product is already associated with quantity on-hand, quantity available or quantity in-transit. Each product is also associate with list and discount prices.
