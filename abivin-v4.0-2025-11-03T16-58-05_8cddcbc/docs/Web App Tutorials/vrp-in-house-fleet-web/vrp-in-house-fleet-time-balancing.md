* By default, the optimized delivery route generated by the system will try to allocate the products as much as possible on each vehicle based on the capacity of the vehicle. However, this can create unbalance tasks for the drivers of a company. Therefore, the **Time Balancing** config can be used to create a balanced delivery time between drivers of a transportation group.
* To use this feature, you need to enable the following configuration at the Branch: **Time Balancing**. Then you can proceed to create orders and optimize routes as usual

## Time Balancing On

* When the **Time Balancing** config is turned on, the route optimization will try to create a balanced delivery time for the driver group meaning that the delivery time will be the priority and the system will attempt to allocate the orders to make the delivery time between drivers balanced. The example below show the optimization result of the delivery group with delivery time close to each other
