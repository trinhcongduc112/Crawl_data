* On the Execution Timeline Panel, click on the :fa-eye: icon of the vehicle which you want to replay the actual delivery route. On the bottom right of the Timeline panel will appear a new set of buttons, serving for playback functions of the actual delivery route

* As you replay the actual delivery route of the vehicle, you might notice that some parts of the actual delivery route display different colors from the rest. Below is the meaning of each color
* 1 - Red color: 

<Image title="QmlVNWZobo.png" alt={90} className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/1d7bf00-QmlVNWZobo.png" />

* There are two possibilities
* The first possibility, the Mobile app lost the GPS signal. In this case, the part of the delivery route having this color will look very disorganized (might consist of various slanting straight lines)
* The second possibility, the driver traveled at a slower speed than the speed of the Vehicle. In this case, the part of the delivery route having this color will still look normal
* 2 - Vivid green color: The vehicle traveled approximately at the same speed registered on the system

<Image title="FTSAlrJlLW.png" alt={92} className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/35e2f78-FTSAlrJlLW.png" />

* 3 - Dark green color: The vehicle traveled relatively faster than the speed registered on the system
