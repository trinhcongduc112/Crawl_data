## Route Plan Definition

* Route Plan is the delivery plan generated by Abivin vRoute that consists of the Optimized Routes of all Sales Orders of a particular Branch on a specific date. A Route Plan will cover the following points:
* 1 - Which vehicles will be utilized
* 2 - How the Orders will be allocated to the vehicles
* 3 - The optimized Delivery Routes of the vehicles

## Switching between Route Plan Map View and Route Plan List View

### 1.1. Necessary set-up to use Route Plan both in Map View and List View

## Move Order/Stop

* There are two situations in which you can move the Orders/Stops
* Situation 1: The Planning Status of a particular Delivery Shift of a vehicle is still ***Planned***, not yet ***Locked***. In this situation, you can move the Orders within a Stop, a whole Stop, or multiple Stops within the Delivery Trips of that Delivery Shift to another Delivery Trip of that same vehicle or the Planned Delivery Shift of other vehicles
* Situation 2: The Planning Status of a particular Delivery Shift of a vehicle is ***Locked***. In this situation, you can move the Orders within a Stop, a whole Stop, or multiple Stops ***only*** within that same Delivery Shift. You can not move the Orders/Stops in that Delivery Shift to other Delivery Shifts of other vehicles

### Move Orders within a single Stop

* To move the Orders within a single Stop, perform the steps below:
* Step 1: Click on the right angle icon **:fa-angle-right:** on the row containing the Vehicle Code to display the Delivery Shift assigned to that vehicle. Continue to click on the right angle icon :fa-angle-right: on the row of the Delivery Shift to display all Delivery Trips within that Delivery Shift
* Step 2: Scroll the horizontal scrollbar of the Route Plan table to the far-right until you see the column **Edit**. Under this column, click on the **Move Order/Stop** text of the Stop you want to move
* Step 3: The **Move Stop/Order** form will appear. On this form, first, you need to click on the **Orders** field. Upon clicking, a list will appear showing the Orders in that Stop. To select the Orders, click on their corresponding checkbox icons :fa-square-o:

> 📘 Useful tip
>
> By default, when opening this form, you can see that none of the Orders on a Stop is selected. That also equals to all Orders on that Stop are selected, so if you initially intend to select all Orders, you don't need to manually select each Order

* Step 4: After the Orders have been selected, click on the **to Vehicle** field. Upon clicking, a drop-down list will appear showing the vehicles which:
* 1. Have also been utilized within that same Route Plan, **and** 
* 2. Have the Delivery Trips still in ***Planned***, not yet ***Locked*** status. Select the vehicle to which you want to move the selected Orders
* Step 5: After the vehicle has been selected, click on the **to Trip** field. The drop-down list will show the available Delivery Trips of the selected vehicle. Select the appropriate Delivery Trip from that list
* Step 6: After the Delivery Trip has been selected, click on the field **to Before Position**. The drop-down list will show the appropriate Stops on the selected Delivery Trip that you can move the Orders to. Select the appropriate position before which you want to move the selected Orders
* Step 7: Click on the **Move** button
* The system will immediately move the selected Orders/Stop to the position you intended

<Image title="move order route plan.gif" alt={1916} className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/8c7d939-move_order_route_plan.gif" />

### Move multiple Stops

* To move multiple Stops at once, follow the steps below:
* Step 1: Click the respective checkbox icons :fa-square-o: of the Stops you want to move to select them
* **Note**: If you initially select a Stop that belongs to a Planned Delivery Trip, you can only continue to select other Stops that also belong to that Planned Delivery Trips or the Planned Delivery Trips of other vehicles. On the other hand, if you initially select a Stop in a Locked Delivery Trip, you can only continue to select Stops within that Locked Delivery Trip

> 📘 Useful Tips
>
> As you select a Stop, the system will display a message above the Route Plan table to indicate whether the Stop you have selected belongs to a Planned Delivery Trip or a Locked Delivery Trip

* 1. The vehicles which have also been utilized in that same Route Plan (Normal black text), **and** 
* 2. The vehicles which have not yet been utilized in that Route Plan (Bold blue text with the ***- empty*** suffix). If the selected Stops belong to not yet locked Delivery Trips, you can select any vehicle you want. On the other hand, if the selected Stops belong to a locked Delivery Trip, you can only select the current vehicle (Even though the drop-down list will still show other vehicles)
* Step 5: After you have selected the vehicle, click on the **Shift** field to select the Delivery Shift of the selected vehicle on which you want to move the selected Stops. Next, click on the **After Position** field to select the position on the selected Delivery Shift, after which you want to move the selected Stops

* Step 5: After the Orders have been selected, click on the **Remove** button
* The system will remove the selected Orders from the current Route Plan and treat them as [**Unplanned (Missing) Orders**](https://docs.abivin.com/docs/vrp-in-house-fleet-route-plan-list-view#section-unplanned-orders)

<Image title="remove orders route plan.gif" alt={1916} className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/ca15440-remove_orders_route_plan.gif" />

### Remove multiple Stops

* To remove multiple Stops from the Route Plan, follow the steps below
* Step 1: Click the respective checkbox icons :fa-square-o: of the wanted Stops to select them
* Step 2: Click the **Remove** button above the top right corner of the Route Plan table.
* After a few moments, the Orders within the removed Stops will become Unplanned (Missing) Orders and will appear on the Unplanned Orders panel

## Move Unplanned (Missing) Orders back to Delivery Route

> 📘 Unplanned Orders on Route Plan (List View) are the same as Missing Orders on Route Plan (Map View). From now on, we will refer to them as ***Unplanned (Missing) Orders*** to minimize confusion

* Unplanned (Missing) Orders are
* 1. Orders that the system doesn't automatically put into the optimized Delivery Routes during the Route Plan optimization process due to various reasons **or** 
* 2. Orders that the system has put into the optimized Delivery Routes during the Route Plan Optimization, but the dispatchers manually remove out of the optimized Delivery Routes afterward
* If there are Unplanned (Missing) Orders during the Route Plan Optimization process, then a button titled **Unplanned Orders** will appear on the toolbar, next to the **Map View** button. To view the list of the Unplanned (Missing) Orders of a Route Plan, click on that button. The **Unplanned Orders** panel will appear on the right side of the screen
* On this panel, the Unplanned (Missing) Orders are grouped by Stops. Click on a Stop will show the Unplanned (Missing) Orders of that Stop. To know the reason why the system treats a particular Order as an Unplanned (Missing)  Order, click on its Order Code
* Here, you can perform the following actions: 
* 1. Move a single Unplanned (Missing) Order back to the Route Plan **or** 
* 2. Move a whole Stop or multiple Stops back to the Route Plan

### Move a single Unplanned (Missing) Order back to the Route Plan

* Follow the steps below to move a single Unplanned (Missing) Orders back to the Route Plan:
* Step 1: Click on the four arrows icon :fa-arrows: of the Unplanned (Missing) Order you want to move
* Step 2: The system will display a confirmation message asking if you want to move that Unplanned (Missing) Order. Click ***OK*** on that message to proceed
* Step 3: The **Move Order into Trip** form will appear
* Step 4: On this form, first you need to click on the field **to Vehicle**. Upon clicking, a drop-down list will show two types of vehicles: 1. Vehicles that have also been utilized in that same Route Plan (Normal black text) and 2. Vehicles that have not been used in that Route Plan (Bold blue text with the ***- empty*** suffix). Click on the vehicle to which you want to move the Unplanned (Missing) Order
* Step 4.1: If the selected vehicle has already been used in that Route Plan, two more fields **to Trip** and **to Before Position** will appear. Click on the **to Trip** field and select the Delivery Trip of the selected vehicle to where you want to move the Unplanned (Missing) Order. Next, click on the **to Before Position** field and select the position on the selected Delivery Trip to before where you want to move the Unplanned (Missing) Order
* Step 5: Finally, click on **Move**. After a few moments, the system will move the Unplanned (Missing) Order to the intended position
