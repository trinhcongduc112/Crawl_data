## Route Plan Optimization process

* Typically, a Route Plan optimization process on the List view consists of the following phases:
* Phase 1: Generate Route Plan Record
* Phase 2: Optimize Route Plan
* Phase 3: Lock Planned Route Plan
* Phase 4: Finalize Locked Route Plan
* Phase 5: Synchronize Finalized Route Plan. This phase is only required for certain user accounts who use the external Transportation management systems (TMS)
* (Optional - Linked with Phase 5) Manually Close Finalized Route Plan
* We will go into the details of each phase below

### Phase 1: Generate Route Plan Record

* To generate a Route Plan record, follow the steps below:
* Step 1: Navigate to the **Transportation > Route Plans** tab
* **Note**: The screen might occasionally appear blank. If you encounter this, refresh the webpage
* Step 2: On this tab, hover your mouse over the yellow plus-circle icon :fa-plus-circle: then click the **Create** icon :fa-pencil:

<Image title="cwRK11tvPp.png" alt={297} className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/00e7eb6-cwRK11tvPp.png" />

* Step 4: The **Create Route Plan** form will appear. On this form, you need to select the Branch and the date to generate the Route Plan record

<Image title="VQXR7IT0mB.png" alt={577} className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/8f9cf53-VQXR7IT0mB.png" />

* The system will start the Route Plan optimization process. The system will take into account the input information, the pre-configured constraints, select the most appropriate Vehicles, assigns the Orders to the Vehicles, then present the optimized Delivery Routes for the Vehicles in the Route Plan table below

<Image title="UI8JNjhfoU.png" alt={1713} className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/c18458a-UI8JNjhfoU.png" />

* On the Route Plan table, the Delivery Route of each Vehicle will occupy one row

<Image title="DcMqcKHmwg.png" alt={1681} className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/6dab9ff-DcMqcKHmwg.png" />

* During this phase, the Planning Status of all the Vehicles' Delivery Shifts are ***Planned***, not yet ***Locked***, therefore you can make adjustments to those Delivery Shifts before locking them. The details will be covered in the following section: [**Route Plan Adjustments**](https://docs.abivin.com/docs/vrp-in-house-fleet-route-plan-list-view#section-route-plan-adjustment)
* The Route Plan screen has various features, which will be described in the [**Route Plan Screen Features**]() section

### Phase 3: Lock Planned Route Plan

* After you have made the necessary adjustments to the Planned Delivery Shifts, you can now lock them
* Step 1: Select the Planned Delivery Shift(s) that you want to lock
* To select a Planned Delivery Shift, tick the corresponding checkbox icon :fa-square-o: of that Delivery Shift. You can select multiple Delivery Shifts

* Note: Make sure that you have assigned the Drivers for each of the selected Planned Delivery Shifts, else the system will prevent you from locking those Delivery Shifts
* After the selected Planned Delivery Shifts have been locked, their Planning Status will update from ***Planned*** to ***Locked***
* At this phase, you can still unlock the Locked Delivery Shifts. To do that, select those Locked Delivery Shifts then click the **Unlock Route** button located above the top right corner of the Route Plan table
* A confirmation dialog will appear. Click **Confirm**. After that, the Locked Delivery Shifts will be unlocked. Their Planning Status will revert from ***Locked*** back to ***Planned***

<Image title="fBNwoF3ha3.png" alt={1739} className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/736ebd4-fBNwoF3ha3.png" />

### Phase 4: Finalize Locked Route Plan

* After the following events:
* 1 - The Planned Delivery Shifts of the Vehicles have been locked on the Abivin vRoute system, and
* 2 - The assigned Vehicles have actually finished loading Products at the manufacturing warehouses and are about to begin their assigned Delivery Shifts;
* Then you need to finalize those locked Delivery Shifts, making them no longer adjustable
* To finalize a Locked Delivery Shift, follow the steps below:
* Step 1: On the **Route Plan Details** screen, navigate to the **Plan** tab
* Step 2: On this tab, select the Locked Delivery Shifts which you want to finalize, then click the **Finalize** button located above the top right corner of the Route Plan table
* After a few moments, the selected Locked Delivery Shifts will be finalized. Their Planning Status will update from ***Locked*** to ***Finalized***

<Image title="CXQvtS0tcL.png" alt={1735} className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/4f3ec64-CXQvtS0tcL.png" />

* Note: Once a Locked Delivery Shift has been finalized, you cannot revert that Delivery Shift back to the ***Locked*** status. You will no longer be able to adjust that Delivery Shift

### Phase 5: Synchronize Finalized Route Plan to the external Transportation Management System (TMS)

> 📘 This phase is only required for certain user accounts who use the external Transportation Management Systems (TMS)

* Right after you have finalized a Locked Delivery Shift, you need to synchronize that Finalized Delivery Shift from Abivin vRoute system to the external TMS
* To do that, follow the step below:
* Step 1: On the **Route Plan Details** screen, navigate to the **Execution** tab

<Image title="YGyZbZuSvF.png" alt={1739} className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/41ae112-YGyZbZuSvF.png" />

* Step 3: Click the **Sync** button located above the top right corner of the Route Plan table. The synchronization status of the Finalized Delivery Shift (Under the **Sync Status** column) will update from ***No*** to ***Yes*** once the synchronization process completes

<Image title="d3uM2fbvhc.png" alt={1734} className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/ed9bdbd-d3uM2fbvhc.png" />

### (Optional) Manually Close Finalized Route Plan

> 📘 This phase is only required for certain user accounts who use external TMS, and can be performed after Phase 5

* After the following events happen:
* 1 - A Delivery Shift has been finalized and synchronized to the external TMS, and
* 2 - The Vehicles have actually performed the Delivery Shifts assigned to them, but the external TMS has yet to forward the delivery result of the Delivery Shifts back to Abivin vRoute system
* Then you can manually close that Synchronized Delivery Shift on the Abivin vRoute system. By closing a finalized Delivery Shift, the Vehicle that has been used to perform that Delivery Shift will be *released* and can be utilized in other Route Plan optimization processes in the future
* To manually close a Finalized Delivery Shift (**Note**: Synchronized Delivery Shifts can also be closed), follow the steps below:
* Step 1: On the **Route Plan Details** screen, navigate to the **Execution** tab
* Step 2: Click the checkbox icon :fa-square-o: of the Finalized Delivery Shift that you want to manually close
* Step 3: Click the **Close Trip** button located above the top right corner of the Route Plan table

* Step 4: Upon clicking, a confirmation message will appear. Click the **Confirm** button on that message
* After this, over at the **Transportation > Vehicles** tab, the Vehicle Status of the Vehicle will update from ***Locked*** to ***Open***

## Route Plan Adjustments

> ❗️ Prevent concurrent actions of multiple users on the Route Plan (List View)
>
> * As of the [**June 08th, 2021 release**](https://docs.abivin.com/changelog/june-08-2021-release-notes), we have implemented a mechanism to prevent multiple users from modifying a specific Route Plan at the same time
> * If you try to modify a Route Plan that is being modified by another user, the system will display this warning message: ***Another user is taking action on this Route Plan!***
> * If you try to modify a Route Plan that is not yet up-to-date because it was recently modified by another user, the system will display this notification: ***This Route Plan has just been modified by another user. You can only take action after reloading the screen***. You need to click **OK** to reload the screen and get the most up-to-date Route Plan

* This section presents the adjustment functions to help you manipulate the Route Plan. The adjustment functions include:
* Unlock Locked Delivery Shift
* Re-Optimize Not-Yet-Locked/Unlocked Delivery Shifts
* Change Vehicle of Planned Delivery Shift
* Change Driver of Planned Delivery Shift

### Unlock Locked Delivery Shift

* After a Delivery Shift has been locked, you can still unlock it by following the steps below:
* Step 1: Click the checkbox icon :fa-square-o: of the Locked Delivery Shifts that you want to unlock
* Step 2: Click the **Unlock Route** button located above the top right corner of the Route Plan table

- Step 3: A confirmation message will appear. On that message, click the **Confirm** button
- The system will unlock the selected locked Delivery Shift. After unlocking, the Planning Status of the locked Delivery Shift will revert from ***Locked*** back to ***Planned***

### Re-Optimize Not-yet-locked/Unlocked Delivery Shifts

* If the Planning Status of a Delivery Shift is 1. still ***Planned***,  not yet ***Locked***, or 2. is previously locked but has recently been unlocked, then you can make changes to the elements of that Delivery Shift such as Products, Vehicles, Orders, Customers, etc.. After making necessary changes to the elements of the Delivery Shift, you will need to re-run the Route Plan optimization process in order for the system to take into account the changes that you have made
* To re-optimize a Deliver Shift, follow the steps below:
* Step 1: Navigate to the **Route Plan Details** screen
* Step 2: Click the **Optimize** button again
* Upon clicking, the system will start the Route Plan optimization process again and will take into account the changes you have made
* Whilst doing this, one tip to help save you time from going back and forth between the Route Plan screen and the setup screens of the elements is to open several tabs of the Web app, with one tab being reserved for the Route Plan screen and the other tab are used for setting up the elements

### Change Vehicle of Planned Delivery Shift

* When the Planning Status of a particular Delivery Shift is still ***Planned***, not yet ***Locked***, status, you can assign another Vehicle to perform that Delivery Shift. The detailed steps are described below
* Step 1: Drag the horizontal scrollbar to the far right of the Route Plan table until you see the **Edit** column. Under this column, click the **Change Vehicle** icon :fa-truck: of the Delivery Shift which you want to change the Vehicle

- Step 2: The **Change Vehicle** form will appear. On this form, click on the **To Vehicle** field. The drop-down list will show the Vehicles that meet the following criteria:
- 1 - Are from the same Depot with the current Vehicle
- 2 - Have the Active Status to be ***Active***
- 3 - Have the same **Vehicle Type** attribute with the current Vehicle
- 4 - Have the Weight/Volume Capacity to at least equal the Total Weight/Volume of the Orders on the Delivery Shift
- On the drop-down list, the Vehicles that appear in blue text are the ones that are not utilized in the current day Route Plan (Though they might be utilized in other days Route Plans). The Vehicles that appear in black text are the ones that are utilized in the current day Route Plan

<Image title="IOC7zjQTed.png" alt={494} className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/b190cc9-IOC7zjQTed.png" />

* Step 3: Select the Vehicle to which you want to reassign the Delivery Shift then click **Change**

- The system will start a checking process to see if the Delivery Shift can be moved to the target Vehicle or not. There are some scenarios:
- Scenario 1: The target Vehicle is not utilized in the current day Route Plan, but is utilized in other days Route Plans. In this scenario, the system will allow you to change to the target Vehicle regardless of the Planning Status of the target Vehicle's Delivery Shift in other days Route Plans. You will just need to click **Confirm** to confirm changing the Vehicle

* Scenario 2: The target Vehicle is utilized in the current day Route Plan. The Planning Status of the Delivery Shift assigned to the target Vehicle is ***Planned***. In this scenario, the system will also allow you to change to the target Vehicle. Click **Confirm** to confirm changing the Vehicle

- Scenario 3: The target Vehicle is utilized in the current day Route Plan. The Planning Status of the Delivery Shift assigned to the target Vehicle is ***Locked/Finalized***. In this scenario, the system will not allow you to change to the target Vehicle

<Image title="OQAwoDAXQb.png" alt={591} className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/8482d3e-OQAwoDAXQb.png" />

### Change Driver of Planned Delivery Shift

* When the Planning Status of a particular Delivery Shift is still ***Planned***, not yet ***Locked***, you can change the Driver to operate the Vehicle that is currently assigned that Delivery Shift. The detailed steps are described below:
* Step 1: Drag the horizontal scrollbar to the far right of the Route Plan table, until you see the **Edit** column. Under this column, click on the **Change Driver** icon :fa-user: of the Delivery Shift that you want to change the Driver

- Step 2: The **Change Driver** form will appear. On this form, click on the **New Driver** field. The drop-down list will show the Drivers that meet the following criteria:

- 2 - Have the Active Status to be ***Active*** (If the desired Driver is currently inactive, you can change his Active Status over at the **Transportation > Drivers** tab)
- 3 - Is not currently assigned to any other Vehicle on that Route Plan
- Step 4: Select the Driver to which you want to reassign the Delivery Shift then click **Change**

### Move Order/Stop

* You can move the Orders/Stops of a particular Delivery Shift if the Planning Status of that Delivery Shift is ***Planned/Locked***, not yet ***Finalized***
* If the Planning Status of that Delivery Shift is Planned, you can move the Orders within a Stop, a whole Stop, or multiple Stops within the Delivery Trips of that Planned Delivery Shift to another Delivery Trip of the current Vehicle or the Planned Delivery Shift of other Vehicles within that same Route Plan
* If the Planning Status of that Delivery Shift is Locked, you can move the Orders within a Stop, a whole Stop, or multiple Stops of that Delivery Shift *only* within that same Delivery Shift. You cannot move the Orders/Stops of that Delivery Shift to other Delivery Shifts of other Vehicles
* There are two Order/Stop moving mechanism: 
* Mechanism 1: Move Single Stop
* This mechanism is currently available for Delivery Shifts in Planned Planning Status
* Mechanism 2: Move Multiple Stops
* This mechanism is available for Delivery Shifts in both Planned and Locked Planning Status

#### Move Single Stop

### Move Unplanned (Missing) Orders back to Delivery Route

> 📘 Unplanned Order = Missing Order
>
> The Unplanned Orders on the Route Plan (List View) screen are the same as the Missing Orders on the Route Plan (Map View) screen. From now on, we will refer to them as **Unplanned (Missing) Orders** to minimize confusion

* Unplanned (Missing) Orders are:
* 1 - Orders that the system could not successfully put into the optimized Delivery Routes during the Route Plan optimization process due to various reasons, or 
* 2 - Orders that the system successfully puts into the optimized Delivery Routes during the Route Plan optimization process, but have then been manually removed out of the optimized Delivery Routes  by the users
* To access the Unplanned (Missing) Orders of the current day Route Plan, click the button titled **Unplanned Orders** on the toolbar above the Route Plan table

- The **Unplanned Orders** panel will appear on the right side of the screen

* On this panel, the Unplanned (Missing) Orders are grouped by Stops. Click on a Stop will show the Unplanned (Missing) Orders of that Stop

- To know the reason why the system treats a particular Order as an Unplanned (Missing) Order, click on its Order Code. The **Unplanned Order Detail** panel will appear to the right of the Unplanned Orders panel

* Here, you can perform the following actions to the Unplanned (Missing) Orders: 
* 1 - Move a single Unplanned (Missing) Order back to the current day Route Plan
* 2 - Move a whole Stop or multiple Stops back to the current day Route Plan

### Move a single Unplanned (Missing) Order back to the Route Plan

* Follow the steps below to move a single Unplanned (Missing) Order back to the Route Plan:
* Step 1: Click on the four arrows icon :fa-arrows: of the Unplanned (Missing) Order you want to move
