### Shipment Device ID Type

* Section: **Mobile**
* In this model, each barge is equipped with a mobile device (A tablet to be specific). The barge captain will use the equipped tablets to submit shipment tasks, instead of their own mobile phones. The shipments therefore will need to be tracked by the vehicles (Barges), not by the users (Barge captains). This configuration will help the dispatchers manage the shipments by vehicles and track the current location of the barges
* There are two options:
* Option 1: IMEI. The tablets equipped on the barges will be managed by their IMEIs
* Option 2: MAC Address. The tablets equipped on the barges will be managed by their MAC Addresses
* For detailed instruction, refer to the following article: [**Manage Barges**](https://docs.abivin.com/docs/freight-transport-sea-barge-manage-barges#store-imeimac-address-of-the-barges-equipped-mobile-device)
