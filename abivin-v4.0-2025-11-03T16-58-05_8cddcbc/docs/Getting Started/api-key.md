* **API** stands for **Application Programming Interface**. In layman's terms, these interfaces are what allow software solutions to communicate with each other
* Since Abivin vRoute very frequently needs to work with other external ERP/TMS, this configuration provides an easy way to help the users set up the connection between these systems
* This configuration is present on tab **More Configurations** of the Manufacturer
* To generate an API key, click on the plus icon :fa-plus:. A random API key will be generated

* You can copy that API key and paste into to the API of your external system (Usually in the header ***X-API-Key***). From then on, the API key will authenticate the API calls between your external system and Abivin vRoute system
* After a while, if you decide to change the API key, you can click on the refresh icon :fa-undo: to generate a new API key
