## Web App General Requirement

* Computer requirement: 
* Operating system: Microsoft Windows 10 or Apple macOS
* CPU: Dual Cores and above
* RAM: 4GB is the bare minimum. 8GB and above is preferred
* Spreadsheet software: Microsoft Office version 2010 and above. Other spreadsheet softwares might have compatibility issues with our templates
* Mobile device requirement (If you wish to access the Web app on your Mobile device):
* iOS: 11 and above. The Web browser should be Safari
* Android: Any device will work, as long as the Web browser is Chrome (Version 80 and above)
* Other Web browsers apart from the ones mentioned above are not recommended
* Input method: Users **must** use the Unicode character set and Unicode fonts when inputting data in the import Excel templates. Abivin vRoute Web App employs the Unicode character set. If you use other character sets when inputting data in the Excel templates, then after importing the data on the Web app will look different than the source data due to the character set incompatibility
* For example: In the image below, I use the **TCVN3 (ABC)** character set and the **.VnTime** font, not a Unicode font. In the Customer import template, I intentionally input the Partner Name as  ***Khách hàng***. However, in the detection box of Excel, the real value is actually ***Kh¸ch hµng***. This is the value that will display on the Web app after the template has been imported

* If I use the Unicode character set and Unicode fonts such as **Arial; Times New Roman; Calibri, etc.** then this issue will no longer occur
