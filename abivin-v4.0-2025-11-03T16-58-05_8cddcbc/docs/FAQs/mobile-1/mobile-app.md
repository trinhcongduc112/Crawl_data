## 1. Your mobile divice has no signal.

:fa-angle-right: Some solution to re-connect the signal:

* Restart your phone or turn on and off the "Flight Mode" on your device to re-connect the signal.
* Check the SIM tray to see if your phone had received the SIM card. 

## 2. Your Mobile device has no or weak network.

:fa-angle-right: Solution: Restart your device.

* This may sound simple, but sometimes it's all you need to do to fix poor connectivity issues.

* If restarting doesn't fix the problem, switch between mobile data and Wi-Fi:\
  **Step 1:** Go to Settings application and press on "Wireless and networks" or "Connect". Depending on your device, these options may vary.\
  **Step 2:** Turn off Wi-Fi and turn on mobile data then check if there is anything different. If not, turn off mobile data then turn on Wi-Fi and see if that fixes the problem. 

## 3. Your phone storage is full

When you take a photo to check in, the Abivin's Mobile application will display a "Loading" message for a long time without processing while your phone is still full of signal and network, your phone may be full of memory.
