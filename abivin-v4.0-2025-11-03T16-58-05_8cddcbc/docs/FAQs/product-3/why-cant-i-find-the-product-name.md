## Why I can't find the Product name by filling in the searching bar?

* **Case:** Regarding the image below as an example, after searching the key word "Chao" in the searching bar, there is no result of these products appear.

* However, in Product, there are 04 product codes having the key word "Chao".

:fa-angle-right: **Reason:** The system requires the input method must be in Unicode for acceptance. If you use other input methods, the system cannot recognize the key word leading to no result of searching.

:fa-angle-right: **Solution:** Change your input method to Unicode and search the key word again. The result of searching will appear normally.
