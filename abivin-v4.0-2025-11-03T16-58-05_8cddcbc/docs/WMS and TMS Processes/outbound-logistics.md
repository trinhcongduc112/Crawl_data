## Picking

Once a Sales Order is received, a "Picking" process will be triggered. The warehouse manager and personnel will travel around the warehouse to pick the correct items for one or multiple orders.

## Packing

Once all items in an order are picked, they will be brought to a picked area for "Packing". Packing means putting items into standard boxes or pallets. The compliance is followed to ensure the reinforcement of item protection. Depending on the warehouse design, the packed orders may be moved to a loading area.

## Shipping

Delivery vehicles will be waiting at the loading areas to load up pallets or boxes into its containers. The warehouse manager will sign off his responsibility to the drivers or delivermen at this point.
