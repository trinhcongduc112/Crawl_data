## Update Strong password

## Update password within Mobile app settings

<Image title="acc setting.png" alt={839} className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/9c315bb-acc_setting.png" />

* Scroll down the Settings screen, you will see a blue **Change Password** button

<Image title="change pass.png" alt={834} className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/c63176c-change_pass.png" />

* Input your current password into the **Current password** field, then input your new password into the **New password** and **Verify password** fields
* As you type the new password, the Mobile app will perform checking to measure your password strength according to our [**Password rules**](https://docs.abivin.com/docs/mobile-app-general-instruction#section-password-rules). Your new password will only be accepted once all the criteria have been met
* After your new password has passed the criteria, tap on the blue **Change Password** button

<Image title="new pass.png" alt={420} className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/4d31da4-new_pass.png" />

* A pop up will display, announcing that you have successfully changed your password to a new, strong password. At the same time, you will be logged out of your account. You will have to log in again using the recently created strong password

## Update password when logging in

* As we periodically roll out the Strong password feature to our clients, users on Mobile app who still use weak passwords will not be able to perform anything unless they change their passwords to stronger ones
* The Mobile app will immediately navigate to the **Change password** screen after logging in
* The process to change weak password to strong password is similar as above

## Password rules

* A strong password will help your organization protect privacy, prevent cyber attacks and data theft. Therefore, we have employed a rigorous set of rules to ensure threats are as minimal as possible
* A strong password is one that complies with the following rules
* **Rule #1**. Contains uppercase letters
* **Rule #2**. Contains lowercase letters
* **Rule #3**. Contains numbers
* **Rule #4**. Contains at least one special characters (Characters that are not numbers and letters, including ! " # $ % & ' ( ) \* + , - . / : ; \< = > ? @ \[ \ ] ^ \_ \` \{ | } \~ " and spaces)
* **Rule #5**. Is at least eight characters long
* As you input the password, the checklist below will help you see what rules you have met. Rules that have been met will have the corresponding icon :fa-check-circle: turn from gray to green

* You will be navigated to the **Recover Password** screen. At the same time Abivin vRoute will automatically send an instruction email to your email address. In the email, you will see a ***Verify Code***
* In case you haven't received the instruction email, tap on **Resend Email** text
