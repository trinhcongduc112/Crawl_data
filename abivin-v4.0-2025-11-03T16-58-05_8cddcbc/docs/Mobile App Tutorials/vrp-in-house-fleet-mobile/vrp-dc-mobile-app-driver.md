* This article will guide you - the driver - on how to perform your delivery tasks on the Mobile app
* Firstly, you are recommended to read the [**Delivery App - General Instruction**](https://docs.abivin.com/docs/mobile-app-general-instruction) article to become familiar with the general functions of the Mobile app

## Sign In To Your Mobile App

* When you first sign in to the Mobile app, you will be greeted with a screen that shows the Vehicle Code of the Vehicle that you are assigned to operate. Tap ***Let's Go*** on that screen to kickstart your day!

<Image title="sign in.gif" alt={420} border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/8af839a-sign_in.gif">

</Image>

## Mobile App Interface

* After signing in, you will see the main screen of the Mobile app. Typically, there will be four tabs: **Tasks, Products, Partners; Orders** (There might be fewer tabs depending on how your account is set up)
* The **Tasks** tab is the default tab that you will see. This tab shows the list of all delivery tasks that you will need to perform. You will spend most of your time on this tab
* The **Products** tab shows the Products inside your Depot/Warehouse
* The **Partners** tab shows the Customers of your Depot/Warehouse
* The **Orders** tab shows the list of Orders that you will need to deliver
* Note: The number of tabs might vary according to how your account is set up

## Delivery Task Overview

* Similar to your actual delivery activities, on the Mobile app, there will be three main tasks for each Delivery Trip:
* 1 - **Product Loading**: You will load Products of the Order onto your Vehicle at the start of your Delivery Trip
* 2 - **Product Delivery**: You will travel to the Customers' receiving locations, hand over the Products, and receive payment
* 3 - **End Delivery Trip**: You will travel back to the Depot after completing all the delivery tasks of the Delivery Trip. Upon your arrival back to the Depot, you will hand over the received payment and the returned Products, if any, to the Depot manager. After that, you can end your Delivery Trip
* Apart from the main delivery tasks, you might also be allowed to create the **Extra Tasks**. The Extra tasks enable you to record unexpected activities during your delivery process, such as flat tires, out of gas, traffic jam, etc.

* Note: If you are required to Check-in by taking a photo at the current standing location, if the dispatcher sets up the geographical constraint, you might encounter the following error message if the distance between your current standing location when tapping on the camera icon and the Customer's actual receiving location exceeds a value. For example, the dispatcher sets up the maximum distance that the dispatchers allow is 10 meters but you stand 20 meters away from the Customer's receiving location

> 🚧 Compulsory Configuration
>
> In order to have this feature on the Mobile app, you need to inform the dispatcher to enable the following configuration at the **Branch**: **Allow Driver Create Extra Task** and also create the Action Code **EXTRA\_TASK**.

<Image title="uILvh0LSdE.png" alt={846} className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/a90e6a9-uILvh0LSdE.png" />

* If you are assigned multiple Delivery Trips, you can move all Stops within a Delivery Trip to the Delivery Trips that precede or follow that Delivery Trip. After doing so, the Mobile App will add the Stops of that Delivery Trip will to the Stop list of the destination Delivery Trip, reducing the total number of Delivery Trips on the task list

<Image title="movetripmobile.gif" alt={488} className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/9884b9f-movetripmobile.gif" />

* After you have adjusted the Delivery Stop sequence, your dispatchers will be notified on the Web App. The detailed information is presented in the following article [**Route Plan Adjustments (Map View)**](https://docs.abivin.com/docs/vrp-in-house-fleet-route-plan-adjustment#route-plan-adjustments-by-the-drivers)
