* During the delivery process, there are certain tasks which require the drivers to perform paperwork, including signing. Such tasks could be: Loading products at the manufacturer's warehouse; Unloading products at the customer warehouse
* In Abivin vRoute, we have simplified that process by implementing the digital signature function. This will act as part of the electronic Proof of Delivery (e-POD)
* On Abivin vRoute mobile app, tasks that require signatures will have a :fa-pencil: icon

* Tapping on that icon will lead to a blank screen. Here, the drivers could give the devices to the personals who need to sign. 
* To write the signatures, simply use your fingers and draw on the mobile screen like this, then tap on **Save**

* If you want to reset the signature, tap on **Reset**, then draw the new signature

* Or if you have tapped **Save**, then, on the task screen, tap on **Change** to get back to the signature screen
