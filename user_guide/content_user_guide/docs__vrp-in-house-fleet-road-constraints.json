This is defined in Abivin vRoute as <strong>Road constraints</strong>. At the moment, Abivin vRoute has been able to provide solutions to some common road constraints:</li>\n<li>Road constraint based on Vehicle gross weight</li>\n<li>Road constraint based on Time window</li>\n<li>Road constraint based on Vehicle license plate number</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"heading heading-2 header-scroll\"><div class=\"heading-text\">Manage Road constraint</div><a aria-label=\"Skip link to Manage Road constraint\" class=\"heading-anchor-icon fa fa-regular fa-anchor\" href=\"#manage-road-constraint\"></a></h2>\n<h3 class=\"heading heading-3 header-scroll\"><div class=\"heading-text\">Create road constraints</div><a aria-label=\"Skip link to Create road constraints\" class=\"heading-anchor-icon fa fa-regular fa-anchor\" href=\"#create-road-constraints\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Transportation &gt; Vehicle List</strong> tab, then click on <strong>View map</strong> icon on the toolbar</li>\n<li>You will be navigated to the Route map screen.
