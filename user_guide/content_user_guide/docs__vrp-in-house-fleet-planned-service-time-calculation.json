This is the default Service Time mechanism of the system</li>\n<li>Mechanism 2 - Manual Customer Service Time. This mechanism is used for the Customers who regularly change their Service Times</li>\n<li>Mechanism 3 - Specialised Service Time. This is a set of several custom Service Time mechanisms that are optimized for certain User accounts</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"heading heading-2 header-scroll\"><div class=\"heading-anchor anchor waypoint\" id=\"service-time-related-concepts\"></div><div class=\"heading-text\">Service Time Related Concepts</div><a aria-label=\"Skip link to Service Time Related Concepts\" class=\"heading-anchor-icon fa fa-regular fa-anchor\" href=\"#service-time-related-concepts\"></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Firstly, there are some time-related concepts that we need you to get familiar with:</li>\n<li>1 - <strong>Base Service Time</strong>. This is a time configuration at the <strong>Branch</strong>. This configuration defines a fixed time period to load/unload a fixed amount of products. The amount could either be weight or volume</li>\n<li>2 - <strong>Service Time Window</strong>. The Service Time Window refers to the time window constraints that the manufacturing Depots and the Customers' receiving locations impose on every Vehicle when loading/unloading Products. The Vehicles must always load/unload products within the imposed time window constraints, no more and no less</li>\n<li>3 - <strong>Service Time</strong>. As mentioned at the beginning of this article, this is the loading/unloading time period that the system applies to the Vehicles during the Route Plan optimization process, the ones you see on the optimized Route Plan. The Service Time is determined by comparing the following two numbers:</li>\n<li>3.1 - The result of the multiplication between the Base Service Time and the amount of Products that a Vehicle is assigned to load/unload at a location (The manufacturing Depot or the Customer's receiving location) during the Route Plan optimization process, and</li>\n<li>3.2 - The Service Time Window imposed by that location</li>\n<li>Now that you've understood these time concepts, let's move on to configure them</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"heading heading-2 header-scroll\"><div class=\"heading-anchor anchor waypoint\" id=\"automatic-service-time\"></div><div class=\"heading-text\">Automatic Service Time</div><a aria-label=\"Skip link to Automatic Service Time\" class=\"heading-anchor-icon fa fa-regular fa-anchor\" href=\"#automatic-service-time\"></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The Automatic Service Time is the default Service Time mechanism of Abivin vRoute system</li>\n<li>To use this Service Time mechanism, you will need to perform the following setup before proceeding to the Route Plan optimization process:</li>\n<li>1 - Set up the Base Service Time at the Branch</li>\n<li>2 - Set up the Service Time Window at the Depot</li>\n<li>3 - Set up the Service Time Window at the Customers</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"heading heading-3 header-scroll\"><div class=\"heading-anchor anchor waypoint\" id=\"set-up-the-base-service-time-at-the-branch\"></div><div class=\"heading-text\">Set Up The Base Service Time At The Branch</div><a aria-label=\"Skip link to Set Up The Base Service Time At The Branch\" class=\"heading-anchor-icon fa fa-regular fa-anchor\" href=\"#set-up-the-base-service-time-at-the-branch\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>To set up the Base Service Time at the Branch, please follow the steps below:</li>\n<li>Navigate to the <strong>Organizations &gt; Organizations</strong> tab</li>\n<li>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> icon <i class=\"fa-regular fa-pencil\"></i> of the Branch you want to set up</li>\n<li>On the <strong>Update Organization</strong> form, navigate to the <strong>More Configuration &gt; Algorithm</strong> sub-tab</li>\n<li>At the top of the algorithms section, you will see a phrase that says: <em><strong>Need[ ] minutes for loading and unloading of packages weighting [ ] kg</strong></em></li>\n</ul>\n<span aria-label=\"Expand image\" class=\"img lightbox closed\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"><span class=\"lightbox-inner\"><img alt=\"1458\" class=\"img border\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://files.readme.io/c505a47-JHboxLAmca.png\" title=\"JHboxLAmca.png\" width=\"auto\"/></span></span>\n<ul>\n<li>If you tick the <strong>Use Volume</strong> checkbox, this phrase will change to <em><strong>Need[ ] minutes for loading and unloading of packages volumn [ ] m3</strong></em></li>\n</ul>\n<span aria-label=\"Expand image\" class=\"img lightbox closed\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"><span class=\"lightbox-inner\"><img alt=\"1454\" class=\"img border\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://files.readme.io/aea779b-JvL8zVMqp3.png\" title=\"JvL8zVMqp3.png\" width=\"auto\"/></span></span>\n<ul>\n<li>This is where you can set up the Base Service Time.
